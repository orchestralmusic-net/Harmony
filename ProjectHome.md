# Harmony #

Harmony is a program in which you can write tones and chords and it will tell you whether they are correct according to classical European harmonic principles. It can also analyze them. In summary, it is a musical editor that is aimed to musical harmony.

This is site for developers and translators of the Harmony program. Site aimed to its users is located [here](http://www.orchestralmusic.net/harmony).

### For developers ###
The whole program was developed in Netbeans IDE. You can download the whole Netbeans project in version 1.1 in the download section.

### For translators ###
You can download the file containing translations in the current version here. Unpack the files and open them in a text editor. Write the translation on the right side of every line (after the "=" symbol). Then send me the translated files and I will incorporate them into the program. I will be very grateful. Hopefully, we will be able to help some people in their musical education.

### Current version ###
The current version of the program is 1.1., issued on 2012-04-05.
